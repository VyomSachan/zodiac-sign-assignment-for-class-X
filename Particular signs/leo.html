                they want and will do whatever they need to in order to get what they want. The Leo star sign 
                people are usually energetic and optimistic. They make great friends because of their generally 
                positive attitude. Sometimes they can seem arrogant and better than others, but this is only one 
                small flaw in the August birthday people.<br><br>
